    """Per-season episode counts from cached (or freshly-fetched) TMDB metadata,
    capped at the last aired episode for shows still airing. Mirrors the
    season_ep_counts calculation in routers.shows.get_show.

    Unaired episodes are excluded three ways, so a still-airing (or between-
    seasons) show doesn't inflate a total (#385):
    - cap the current season at last_episode_to_air, but only if it has
      actually aired - TMDB's copy often runs a day or two ahead;
    - if next_episode_to_air is set, everything from it onward is unaired;
    - drop any whole season whose premiere date is still in the future, which
      also covers TVDB-sourced shows that carry neither *_episode_to_air field.

    That third check alone still let a renewed-but-unscheduled season through
    (#385 follow-up): TMDB sometimes adds a placeholder next season with a
    nonzero episode_count and NO air_date at all (not a future one - simply
    absent, since nothing's been scheduled yet), and "no date" fails an
    "is this date in the future" check either way. When last/next_episode_to_air
    are both missing too - the only case this whole-season check is actually
    relied on, since a real cap already zeroes anything past it regardless of
    that season's own date - and the show is confirmed still active
    ("Returning Series" or similar, not "Ended"/"Canceled"), a season is only
    kept if its air_date is on or before today; missing no longer assumed
    fine there, mirroring _has_confirmed_air_date's reasoning for Next Up.
    A concluded show (or one with no status recorded at all) keeps the old,
    lenient reading - it has nothing left to announce, so a season with no
    air_date recorded is just an ordinary metadata gap, not a sign it hasn't
    happened yet.
